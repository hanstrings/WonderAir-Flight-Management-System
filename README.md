# WonderAir: Flight Management System

This project simplifies the heavy doing of flight management system. This code provides the user 3 ways of operating the program. One as a simple passenger who just inputs his data as a pre-requisite for booking a flight, second is for an Employee of the company who is on board, of course he/she doesn't have to pay but rather to enter a specific entitled to them to prove their identity and the third is member who travels abroad quite so often. Yes, we said 'internationally' as our program only provide the facility to travel abroad and generate price accordingly.
Yet a complicated work to accomplish, but that’s not what makes our work standout the rest, it’s the user interference we have achieved by thoroughly using windows generated commands to make it appear elegant using command line interference.
The code itself is password protected i.e. the user must acknowledge the password to advance further. The code is as user friendly as it we could get it to be, you move backwards through any given choice if a key was pressed accidentally.
Another functionality that makes our project unique is the through using of filing system. All the data inputted or outputted through system stream is saved permanently by filing and can be viewed evenly. All the username and passwords for a member are saved separately on a file system; whereas, a passenger and member both can view and print their generated boarding pass almost instantly.
